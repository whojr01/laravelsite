                        Whomever, visits your website creates your Presence from the Inception of your idea, as a seed
                        that
                        grows, if they enjoy their experience on your site.

                        The user experience, simply defined, is what got you from my main page to this page, curiosity.
                        The central theme for exploring is curiosity, although curiosity isn’t enough, the user also
                        needs a purpose and that purpose has to align with your design.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Creating the user experience is about feeding their curiosity through content and purpose. The
                        visuals of the site, the controls, how they get from the main page to the checkout box fortifies
                        that
                        experience.

                        The systematic computational analysis of data or statistics really doesn’t sound as exciting as
                        it
                        can be,
                        until it tells the story about the visitors to your site (The User Experience).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The measurement of how successful your design is in triggering the curiosity factor, how they
                        interact with your site, is through website analytics. In essence analytics connects the user
                        experience to the goals of the site and tells the story of when the two met.

                        A website development does not stop at the creation of a few web pages, it is only the
                        Inception,
                        what
                        happens or doesn’t happen after that determines your Presence. How your users view your website
                        is a
                        measurable experience.

                        On the internet, you can pay to attract users to your site or you can let your customers find
                        you
                        through
                        word of mouth. The former is called Cost per Click as you pay for internet ads and the latter is
                        FREE
                        through user curiosity or word of mouth.

                    <p>
                        Your website must have a single focused goal to inform users, generate leads, or generate sales.
                        The
                        success
                        of your website can be measured to determine if you’re meeting or exceeding the goal you set
                        (Analytics).

                    <p>
                        Finding new customers is the key for the survival of most businesses. How you generate leads,
                        provide
                        services, or entertain are all factors that must be considered in the design of your site. After
                        all, it’s
                        the user experience that is going to define your presence, keep them on the site longer and
                        share
                        with their
                        friends.

                    as simple as using, HTML/CSS with a bit of PHP/Javascript and a database, very similar to how this

                    devices used by your target audience.
