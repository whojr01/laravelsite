                        <p>
                            Whojr, Inc. has been in business since 2004, primarily, focused on supporting the
                            IBM/Rational
                            suite of software configuration management tools.

                        <p>
                            Today, Whojr, Inc. has a new beginning, a fresh start, after fourteen years of building
                            software
                            development environments; it has planted a new seed in web development.

                        <p>
                            The web has grown to become an integral tool for business and personal connections,
                            communicating key ideas relevant to its audience. What started with static pages has evolved
                            into dynamic, responsive pages that flex to any device size. To communicate effectively
                            across the world you will need more than static pages to convey your message, you need a
                            responsive approach to reach your audience.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your audience is no longer just in an office. They are on airplanes, trains, buses, and at
                            your local coffee shop. Your exceptional content needs to sit with them, informing them of
                            your message, and allowing them to buy your products immediately.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We believe the bold, informative design that conveys your message, created by your talented
                            staff or designer, needs the proper functionality into for it to be an effective tool. It
                            needs to function correctly on the smaller devices while effectively adapting to the larger.
                            It’s a feat that takes skill to deliver across the ever changing landscape of technology in
                            order to reach your audience.

                            Gimmicks when used like the vaudeville huckster, selling the elixir to cure an ailment,
                            detract
                            and obscure the message of a site when used improperly. The maturity of the internet favors
                            relevant content, a flavorful user experience, and a sumptuous meal that sates its audience
                            appetite. This only comes from a well thought out content coupled with properly functioning
                            controls that are not overly cumbersome, slow, or simply there as eye candy.

                        <p>
                            Your design is the seed of inception that grows into a presence conveying your message to
                            its respective audience regardless of where they are located. Your presence should
                            respectfully value their time on your site and not waste it with cumbersome navigation,
                            pointless gimmicky controls, or fail to function on their device.

                        </p>
